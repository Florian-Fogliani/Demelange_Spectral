# Demelange Spectral

>The study of the properties of small bodies in our solar system helps add pieces to the puzzle of planetary formation. In particular, understanding the absorption bands of solar light they reflect allows the determination of compounds present on the surface. To achieve this today, astronomers and planetary scientists compare the spectra of objects, obtained through various instruments, with simulated spectra of different compounds. The goal, after gaining expertise in existing learning methods in this field, is to develop a method for obtaining a list of compounds likely present in a spectrum, along with their associated probabilities.

This project is conducted as part of the ING1 research track at EPITA.
